There is an exponential curve to the slowdown so you wouldn't even notice this system if you AFK for small amounts at a time, as that would just be annoying. This system really only takes into place once you AFK for a while, which makes sense as that would mean you're idling instead of simply being away from your computer for a short amount of time. Additionally, there is a cap to the amount of AFK score you can obtain, so that even if you AFK for multiple days at a time, you could recover it all by playing just for 2-3 hours.
