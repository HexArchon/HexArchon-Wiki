That's why this system was implemented. You can now build big arms without any restrictions, and the output is now more balanced as growth rates will gradually slow down as you AFK (ONLY if you are near active farms). There is an exponential curve to the slowdown so you wouldn't even notice this system if you AFK for small amounts at a time, as that would just be annoying. This system really only takes into place once you AFK for a while, which makes sense as that would mean you're idling instead of simply being away from your computer for a short amount of time. Additionally, there is a cap to the amount of AFK score you can obtain, so that even if you AFK for multiple days at a time, you could recover it all by playing just for 2-3 hours.
