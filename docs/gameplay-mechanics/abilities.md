### Explanation:
![Ability Casting](./img/abilities/ability-casting.png)

To cast abilities, you must be in casting mode. You can toggle casting mode on/off by pressing the `F` (Swap Item) key. From here, the binded abilities will be shown above your hotbar. To cast an ability, press the associated number shown to the left of the ability name.

In this example, you would press the `2` key to cast Fire Storm, `3` to cast Minor Healings, and `4` to cast Empowered Attack.

## Mana

Most abilities require mana, which is displayed as the blue bar above your hotbar. To obtain more mana or to increase the regeneration speed of your mana, you can upgrade your intelligence stat in `/stats`, or craft custom items or runes that increase your mana gain.
