# Abilities

Abilities play a huge role in progress as they grant special passive and active skills. The abilities menu can be accessed with `/abilities`.

## Obtaining Points

![Abilities Menu](./img/abilities/abilities-menu.png)

Points ![Point](./img/abilities/points.png) can be obtained by killing custom mobs, bosses, and opening crates. With points ![Point](./img/abilities/points.png), you can purchase ability points ![Ability Point](./img/abilities/ability_point.png), used to upgrade abilities. With 4 ability points ![Ability Point](./img/abilities/ability_point.png), you can increase your ability activation level, which will unlock new abilities.

## Abilities Menu

## Viewing and Selecting Abilities

## Ability Types & Conditions
![Ability Types](./img/abilities/ability-types.png)

There are two types of abilities: Active and Passive. Active abilities require you to manually cast the ability. Passive abilities activate automatically.

Some abilities may also have casting conditions. For example, the Fire Storm ability requires you to aim at a target to cast the ability.

## Upgrading Abilities

![Ability Upgrade](./img/abilities/ability-upgrade.png)

While an ability is selected, you can choose to upgrade it by clicking on the middle glass item. To the left, you can view your selected ability's current level, and to the right, you can preview your selected ability's next level.

## Binding Abilities

![Ability Slots](./img/abilities/ability-bind.png)

While an ability is selected, you can bind it to one of the 8 slots by left-clicking on an inactive slot. 

The first 6 slots are "Active Ability" slots - you can only bind active abilities to those slots. The last 2 slots are "Passive Ability" slots - you can only bind passive abilities to those slots.

The slot you bind an ability to will determine the number you would press to activate the ability. For example: If you bind an ability to the second slot, you will press the [2] key to cast the ability.

To unbind an ability from a slot, right-click on an occupied slot.

## Mana

![Mana](./img/abilities/mana.png)

Most abilities require mana, which is displayed as the blue bar above your hotbar. To obtain more mana or to increase the regeneration speed of your mana, you can upgrade your intelligence stat in `/stats`, or craft custom items or runes that increase your mana gain.
