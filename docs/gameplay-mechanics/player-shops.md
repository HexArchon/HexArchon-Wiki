# Player Shops
How to create player shops.

Player Shops let you sell and buy items with other players. They can be a good alternative to auctions as there are no item list limits, and can catch other players' attention more effectively with your shop builds. <br />

## Purchasing an Item

To purchase an item from a shop plot, it's simple! Just left-click a shop sign, and type the amount you want to buy in the chat. You can also preview enchantments and attributes of the item being sold as well.

## Creating a Shop
You can choose to either create a player shop anywhere in the main overworld, or at `/warp playershops` if you are whitelisted. If you decide to create a player shop somewhere other than `/warp playershops`, make sure to create a player warp (`/pwarp`) so let other players know that your shop exists.

To create a shop chest, follow the steps below.

1. Place down a chest.
2. Face the chest.
3. Hold the item you want to sell in your hand.
4. Type `/pshop create <price>` (Will reference the item in your hand), or `/pshop create <price> <item> <amount>`.
5. Your shop is now created!

## Getting Whitelisted (Player Shops World)
If you would like to build and create your own shop at `/warp playershops`, you need to be whitelisted. To get whitelisted, you must meet the following requirements:
- Minimum of one week since the first join date on the server.
- Minimum playtime of 20 hours (can be seen in `/settings` -> click your head at the top)
- No history of any rule violations.

If you meet these requirements and would like to apply for the whitelist, you can do so by opening a ticket on our [Discord.](https://discord.hexarchon.net/)

After being whitelisted, you will be free to do any modifications in the player shops world. However, note that the standard no-theft/griefing rules still apply. Failure to obey the rules will result in permanent suspension from trust and further consequences.

:::caution
Using excessive amounts of space (>40x40x40) in the player shops world is prohibited, unless the community deems it acceptable.
:::

:::warning
Shop chests will be protected from any players. However, any non-shop chests in the player shops world are **not protected.**
:::

:::warning
If you are making a claim on your player shop, make sure to enable the "Interactions" permission in your Global Claim Settings (`/claimsettings`). Otherwise, no one will be able to use your shop!
