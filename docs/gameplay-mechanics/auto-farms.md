# Auto Farms
How to use and upgrade Auto Farms.

![Auto Farm](./img/auto-farm.png)

Auto Farms can be bought in the `/shop`. Farms are fully automatic, do not require a water source, and will replant/replace/pick up any crops/ores in its radius.

:::warning
You can only have 5 auto farms of any type placed at a time.

:::warning
Auto farms require the chunk to be loaded to function! And no, there is no artificial way to have a chunk loaded. That would be too overpowered :)
