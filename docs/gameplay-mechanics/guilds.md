# Guilds
Guilds allow you to create a group for other players to join, which may be useful with co-op. __Guilds are NOT related to dungeon parties in any way - this is a seperate system.__

## Creating a Guild
To create a guild, use the `/g create <GuildName>` command. Creating a guild is free, and there are no maintenance fees.

## Managing your Guild
